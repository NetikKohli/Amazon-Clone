It did not even fall down and the only movement is from one corner of the room to the other. It's too late to return now so I'm using it with just the lower rod but really wasted my money on this.,Good product,I use heaters all the time. I've used Havells, orpat and usha in the past. But Hilton is by far the best, generates good amount of heat, better than other heaters I've used. It's also a good looking one. I'm definitely going to stick to this from hereon.I'm writing this so more people give this a try and this great product gets its due appreciation.,I‚Äôm using since 1 week & I must say it‚Äôs very good & best in the market,Heating power is very poor",

        "review_content": "I ordered this mi camera recieved the product but it was defective not working properly so i called customer care and placed the request for replacementThe replacement order was supposed to be delivered by 26 dec 2022But today is 3rd jan 2023 it is yet not delivered i am being told the package has been lost you return the defective product and you will get the refund.After waiting so long the product is not delivered and i will get the refund very bad service from Amazon,Night Vision is Good sometimes person detected notification will be delayed and motion detection sometimes doesn't work other than that everything is good,The camera supports 64GB of memory card, while the online storage as mentioned in the details of 7 days rollover in India is missing.,Remember... nothing is perfect. Xiaomi has already released home security cameras using other brands such as Yi. And the home security camera market is yet to be adapted in large. So, you can expect a lot of misunderstanding on how everything works together in a home security camera in general.Initial setup: It is a breeze for some, but pain for others. See the 1-star ratings if you want proof. I had trouble getting this camera recognized by its own app (Mi Home). It took about 1 hour to recognize after trying with different lighting conditions. The camera got disconnected from the app, after I switched the SSID of the router. So, I had to pair it again. This time, it took more than a day(!) of trial and error. I had to keep the camera under bright sun light in order to get recognized by the Mi Home app. Lesson learned in a hard way.Bandwidth requirement: This camera requires 24x7 connectivity with solid internet connection and with good upload bandwidth. Even if you have 100mbps connection, this camera can only be connected via wireless. So, longer the distance from the router, shorter the bandwidth. This camera hangs up, if it doesn't have enough bandwidth. If you add NAS storage, you'd need even more bandwidth between the camera and the router. The camera is very sensitive. If you set up any conflicting configurations, it'd just hang and would not record anything at all, even in the on-board SD card storage. If the camera hangs for a particular reason, you have to restart it. It is a pain to troubleshoot things when you are miles away from home in another city.Mi Home app requires almost all the permissions from your phone. But, I was able to disable most permissions except location and storage. What's more! You get ads in the app right after opening it (on the dashboard where you see the list of devices) since version 5.4.43 (released on Dec 26, 2018). I wish Xiaomi released a dedicated app for home security cameras, like other companies have done.Google Assistance isn't compatible with this camera, if you are into that sort of thing. Some other cameras from Xiaomi (not released in India) are supported, though.Once paired to the app and once you have the perfect setup (with NAS and good wireless bandwidth to / from the camera), you may become addicted to use it under different conditions, such as with total darkness.If you are technically sound and have around 10k budget, Raspberry Pi based home security is a better option! If you are on a budget and if you don't want to spend a lot of time on technical things, then, Xiaomi Mi Home Security Camera is the best home monitoring camera you can get!,Good enough! It works as it shown,Nice camera and easy to install. Only issus is motion censor doesn't work,It's good but price is high and sometime it's not working so good can't take motion recording.,Not up to mark",

No charging issues.Build quality is plastic and can feel it.Ear buds tips aren't comfortable for long  listening. But ok for upto 2 hrs.No highs, no mids, no lows. But are stereo enabled.One can't expect a bose or apple quality at 4% of their price.So finally justice done for the price paid.If one don't want to spend high, one can't expect a better quality than this.,More often than not you find TWBs that are expensive or don't fit well, or one has a problem with sound quality.But at this price point these buds are exceptional.I bought them for use at night just before sleeping... They don't come out of your ear making it comfortable to sleep with. The sound quality is decent with no misses on mids and voice quality over calls is good.,Pros:1) Overall sound quality is better than other brands. Bass is good. Go for it, if you got for ears for some good listening. The distinctions are good.2) It is Comfortable and fits on ear for casual hearing.3) Battery lasts long. I bearly use for 2-3 hours a day.and charge once in a week or 10 days once.Cons:1) Not recommended for calls. Noise cancellation for calls is poor.2) Not comfortable for sporting activities. Mostly fits well but comparatively slips easily, than the traditional designed ones.3) Touch controls are uneasy, as the touch point is above the hearing point.,Sabhi kuch accha hai lakin battery backup may kamjor hai, 50% Kay bad bhaut jadi battery khatam hote hai.baki sab kuch accha hai.,A very good product till i have used..keep it up,I liked it but it was not up to my hopes as stopped working just after return window got closed,I feel it's not worth spending INR 5,000 - 20,000, this product is definitely the best in the market at this price range.My expectation with this product was simple: to offer good noise cancellation and up-to-mark battery backup, which is delivered.I have used it for the last 3 months., except for a few fluctuations while listening to music.Used it for calls and gaming, and I'm satisfied.Lastly, if you are looking for the purpose of calling, this device and all others fulfil the requirement but in my experience of using different kinds of products, I felt a need for a silent room for the purpose of calling.Highly recommend this product, much better than the other high-range products.",

I‚Äôve seen it turn off in just 30 seconds a couple of times but that‚Äôs all.
